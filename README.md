Tradition, i guess...

Apparently I am supposed to write something about myself here.
I find this stupid, so I am not going to do that. 
This file is public, and because I don't want you to know all of my backgroundstory, I am not going to say anything.
If I would be as naive as the ones who made the guide, I would put all of my personal info here.
Nobody cares if I had tacos on the moon! Nobody needs to know!

Bye, I guess...
